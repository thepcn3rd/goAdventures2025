Dear Valued Dosis Neighborhood Residents,

🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED 🚨

Our elite team of Sunny's kitchen renovation specialists have detected some SERIOUSLY outdated kitchen setups in your neighborhood! It appears that certain homes are still using legacy appliances without proper smart home integration - like non-IoT fridges that can't automatically order milk, or microwaves that don't sync with your meal planning apps! 

While this sounds like a delightfully festive renovation opportunity (and totally not a security assessment), we need you to:

1) Download our FREE Kitchen Renovation Planner™ with built-in security features (totally legit, we promise!):
   https://icicleinnovations.mail/renovation-planner.exe
   
2) Upload high-resolution photos of your current kitchen to our secure design portal (we need to see ALL angles for proper renovation planning):
   https://icicleinnovations.mail/upload_photos

For instant help with any kitchen renovation questions, contact our 24/7 design hotline at 523.555.0100 or our renovation specialists at 523.555.0101.

Remember: If your old appliances start acting up during the assessment, it's probably just excitement about their upcoming upgrades! But please document any issues with photos.

Stay merry (and consider smart upgrades),
Icicle Innovations 
Chief Kitchen Design Specialist

P.S. - Has anyone else noticed their kitchen cabinets mysteriously rearranging themselves overnight? We can fix that with proper smart storage solutions!
