# Adventures of Learning Go 2025

The following collection of golang programs are for educational use only.  In 2023 I started learning golang and have loved the journey.  Due to the size of the previous repository I have created a new one for this years projects.

# Operation 127.1 Lab
This is a collection of programs that I build in my home lab, CTFs, HTB or other related activities for a variety of purposes.  The purposes of these programs range across all spectrum's of cyber security.  Each program will have a brief explanation here and then they may possibly have more information on a dedicated page for the program. 

![Armored Scorpion](/picts/armoredScorpion.png)

[Add ASN Info to a List of IP Addresses](/addASNInfo/README.md) - Simple program to take the input of a single IP Address or read a list of IP Addresses from a file and output in CSV format the information.  Does depend on ipinfo.io and the IP + ASN and Country database. (Uses semaphores and a waitgroup to allow concurrent go routines.  Also identified how to modify the cores used, currently it is set to use half of the cores available and sets the semaphore to 2x the number of cores.)

[Calculate File Entropy of a Single File](/calcEntropyFile/README.md) - Program generates using the Shannon algorithm the entopy of a file and provides output.  This will also break the file down into chunk sizes and then provide in the output the chunks that have an entropy score greater than the file.  This information allows you to find hidden backdoors or encrypted information in a file.

[Calculate File Entropy Recursively in a Directory](/calcEntropyDirectory/README.md) - Program generates using the Shannon algorithm the entropy of files in a specified directory. You have a variety of options to tune the depth of directories it will recursively search and others.

[Check HIBP API aka pwnedPasswords](/pwnedPasswords/README.md) - Created a simple golang program to call the HIBP API using the k-anonymity model to see if a SHA1 or NTLM hash exists.  The k-anonymity model takes the first 5 characters and sends to the API, the API returns the remaining 27 or 35 characters of all of the hashes with the first 5 characters, then compares the suffix with the hashes returned to see if they exist.  You can also read a file of NTLM or SHA1 hashes.

[Create OTP](/createOTP/README.md) - Created a simple golang program to use to generate a "Secret Code" to input manually to google authenticator or it generates a QR Code using CyberChef local or online.  This is a program that I needed to build prior to another project that is coming.

[Validate OTP](/validateOTP/README.md) - Accompanies the CreateOTP golang program.  After the creation of an OTP and the code is shown on a google authenticator, then you input the code provided to be validated in this application.

[DNS Server](/dnsServer/README.md) - Simple DNS Server written in Golang to perform local lookups and then forward any additional requests to an upstream DNS server.  Designed it to be simple and to create a log or send the log by syslog to Elastic inside of a Security Onion Solution.

[Elastic Query](/queryElastic/README.md) - Created a simple golang script to execute a query for the logs generated by the DNS Server to the Elastic server.  The script uses the official go Elasticsearch client. This script accepts a regular expression to parse out the domain being forwarded to the upstream device.  This allows for statistical analysis to be conducted outside of Kibana.

[go RunAs](/goRunAs/README.md) - Simple program that can be used to execute a program on a Windows OS with specified credentials.  Accepts domain credentials also for privilege escalation.  An interactive mode is available.

[Gmail Search](/gmailSearch/README.md) - Created a simple golang program to use the Google Cloud Gmail API to query my email, identify emails that are based on a query in the config.json file, and then allow the decision of to delete (with appropriate permissions setup as gmail.modify) or archive the email.

[Hash/String Scanner](/hashScanner/README.md) - Took the [familiar program](https://github.com/psypanda/hashID) of hashID and modified it to work with scanning a file or files in a directory.  Also modified the structure to allow for disabling the detection of certain hash detection's depending on the project.  You can also extend what is scanned based on templates that you create or customize.  (Uses semaphores and a waitgroup to allow concurrent go routines)

[Generate Hashed Password](/generateHashedPassword/main.go) - Used this simple generator to support the hash identifier.  I would use this to generate multiple hashes of a given algorithm and then to test the regex that I created.

[Home Lab](/picts/1271Network.png) - Here is a diagram of my home lab.  The information is not accurate but captures the information necessary to assist with adding context to the below programs I have created.

[HTTP Method Test](/httpMethodTest/main.go) - Simple way to test if METHODS are enabled using golang on HTTPS sites.  Pass command line flags or u for url and m for the method you are testing.

[HTTPS Display Certs](/httpsDisplayCert/main.go) - Simple way to pull the certification information from an HTTPS connection.  Created a browserHeaders.json which allows you to customize the request headers sent to the server.

[IP Address Generator](/ipAddressGenerator/README.md) - Simple program to create test data that can be consumed by the IP Address Relationships using a Neo4j database.  The test data emulates the output of a firewall log with a source IP address, destination IP address, protocol, and ports.

[IP Address Relationship Mapper](/ipAddressRelationships/README.md) - Simple program to take input of a source IP address, destination IP address, protocol and ports; create nodes and then relationships can be queried using a neo4j database.  This can be used to determine network segmentation, security attack paths, etc.

[LDAP Injection](/ldapInjection/main.go) [LDAP Injection Episode 2](/ldapInjectionEp2/main.go)- ippsec created a video about using go to conduct LDAP injection through the web page presented in the Ghost HTB machine.  ippsec is amazing!

[Local File Include Vuln Scanner](/dirTraversal/README.md) - Simple scanner to test for a Local File Include (LFI) vulnerability.  The parameters can be customized in the config.json file.  Currently only supports a GET Request, will enhance to support POST in the near future.

[Multi-Protocol Proxy](/multiProtocolProxy/main.go) - Created a proxy that reads a JSON configuration file to setup HTTP, HTTPS, and/or TCP proxies.  The proxies will use the subdomain specified.  Currently logging is not setup for the use of the proxies.  (Some of the code is from sslRevProxy.  This code uses go routines to run multiple proxies at one time. The config file will only allow the setup of 1 TCP proxy.  Supports multiple sub-domains)

[NIST CVE Query w/ AI Analysis](/aiAdventures/nistCVEv2/README.md) - Used the code from this project [NIST CVE Query](/nistCVE/main.go) and added the capability to query Brave for matching search results per CVE, then I am using Google ADK to use sequential agents to verify the search results match and summarize the information.  The output can be used to see which CVEs are in the news! 

[oll0ma](/oll0maBurpExtension/README.md) - This is an API server to queue requests sent from the oll0ma extension in Burp.  The server will queue and then process the requests and save the output.  Then the output can be viewed in the oll0ma File Viewer burp extension.  This alleviates the wait and the processing that burp has to conduct waiting and queuing the requests.  Credits to burference, Verizon Red Team AI and openwebui/ollama for the ideas and the spark of creativity to build this.

[Ollama and Open WebUI](/ollama/README.md) - These notes cover configuring a **"Model Preset"** and testing its functionality with an external tool emulating an API. Whether for research, coding, or task automation, this walk through aims to help others deploy their own **private LLM** efficiently. 

[PCI 4.0 12.3.3 - Document SSH algorithms](/parseNmapXMLSSH/README.md) - Program to take the output of the nmap script for ssh-enum-algos and create a CSV File to be used for the requirement

[PCI 4.0 12.3.3 - Document TLS cryptographic cipher suites and protocols](/parseNmapXMLTLS/README.md) - Program to take the output of the nmap script for ssl-enum-ciphers and create a CSV File to be used for the requirement

[Proxmox Query](/proxmoxQuery/README.md) - Created a simple golang program to call the Proxmox API to return the VMs and some simple information of the VMs related to memory, CPU usage, and storage.  I started building this to create the foundation  that would allow the creation of a VM using a template specified in the config file.

[Reverse Shell Client](/revShellClient/main.go) - Built a simple client to catch and interact with a powershell, netcat or bash reverse shell.  The client will log to an output.log file by default.  I also included the functionality to call a list of commands from a script, this is due to executing some of the same commands every time a reverse shell is executed.  A sample script called windows.txt is included in the scripts folder.  This script can be called by executing as a command "script:filename.ext" then it will loop through the commands in the file with a 1 second delay between them.

[Reverse Shell](/revShell/main.go) - This connects to the reverse shell client, this adds a couple of built in functions to upload and download.  Upload to transfer in base64 chunks to the client and then download to use the net/http library to download from an URL.

[Screenshot using a Headless Browser](/headlessScreenshot/README.md) - Created a simple program to hit a website and create a screenshot.  This is helpful if I need to visit what could be a nefarious site.  It saves a screenshot of a list of URLs from a file or a list in the config.json file.

[SMTP Client](/smtpTLSClient/main.go) - Enhanced the previous version that I wrote [here](https://github.com/thepcn3rd/goAdventures/blob/main/archive/smtpSendEmails.go) and added options in a config.json file to send  unencrypted email on SMTP/25, with authentication on SMTP or TLS, and encrypted with SMTPTLS/587.  Learned how to output the TLS Key to a file so it can be used in wireshark to decrypt the SMTP traffic for inspection.  Has the ability to send the emails as plain-text or HTML.  Also added the functionality to include an attachment.

[SSL Reverse Proxy](/sslReverseProxy/README.md) - Setup a guacamole server by using docker to connect to multiple VM instances installed on a proxmox.  By default the guacamole server does not enable SSL, instead of modifying the docker image or setting up a nginx reverse proxy; I built this custom reverse proxy from a previous project.  This also allows logging to a local file or by syslog to Elastic.

[STIX Indicator Parser](/stixParser/README.md) - Built to parse a STIX file and provide output that you structure to a teams webhook.  This is helpful for building specific queries from the STIX files or building automation to run the queries and provide the results.  (Also used go interfaces to learn more about them and how they work with dynamic content.)

[xll Files](/xllBuilder/main.go) - An XLL file is an Excel Plugin that is basically a DLL.  This was created for the HTB: Axlle to create an XLL, send by email and then get a reverse shell.  The prep.sh file allows you to automate the compilation.

# Refreshed Programs

[HTTP2.0 Test](/h2test/main.go) - Simple golang program to test if a web server responds with the protocol HTTP/2.0.

[NIST CVE Query](/nistCVE/main.go) - A simple program that pulls the CVE information for the previous 24 hours of a given day, searches the descriptions for keywords and then displays the results in a **Teams Message**.  (Enhancements were to move the keywords into a config.json file)  If this is used in a scheduled task the config.json file needs to be referenced with the full path.

[Web Request v2](/webRequestv2/main.go) - Created a new version of the web request that I created in goAdventures under projects.  This one is more dynamic and flexible.  The purpose of building this is for requests that need additional logic built into them where Burp Suite by default is not able.
