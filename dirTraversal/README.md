# HTTP Fuzzing Tool

This tool is designed to perform HTTP fuzzing by sending various payloads to a target URL and analyzing the responses. It supports GET requests and can be configured to use different payloads, headers, and delays between requests.

## Features

- **Configurable via JSON**: The tool reads its configuration from a `config.json` file, allowing users to customize the target URL, request method, user agent, delay between requests, payloads, and more.
- **Payload Support**: Payloads can be loaded from a file or specified directly in the configuration.
- **Output Saving**: Responses that exceed a specified body size are saved to files in an output directory.
- **Delay Between Requests**: To avoid overwhelming the target server, a delay can be specified between consecutive requests.
- **Insecure SSL Support**: The tool can skip SSL certificate verification for testing purposes.

## Configuration

The tool uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) to define its behavior. Below is an example configuration:

```json
{
    "destinationURL": "https://127.0.0.1:9000/download.php",
    "method": "GET",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/124.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "delayBetweenRequests": 0,
    "targetKey": "file",
    "keyValuePairs": [
        {
            "key": "test",
            "value": "testing"
        },
        {
            "key": "",
            "value": ""
        }
    ],
    "outputDirectory": "output",
    "payloadType": "File",
    "payloadFilename": "./github/SecLists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt",
    "payloadList": [
        "..\\..\\..\\..\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts",
        "../../../../etc/passwd",
        "..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd"
    ],
    "bodySize": 200
}
```

### Configuration Fields

- **destinationURL**: The target URL to which the requests will be sent.
- **method**: The HTTP method to use (currently only GET is supported).
- **userAgent**: The User-Agent string to use in the HTTP requests.
- **delayBetweenRequests**: The delay in seconds between consecutive requests.
- **targetKey**: The key in the query string where the payload will be inserted.
- **keyValuePairs**: Additional key-value pairs to include in the query string.
- **outputDirectory**: The directory where responses that exceed the body size will be saved.
- **payloadType**: Specifies whether the payloads are loaded from a file or provided directly in the configuration.
- **payloadFilename**: The file containing the payloads if `payloadType` is "File".
- **payloadList**: A list of payloads to use if `payloadType` is not "File".
- **bodySize**: The minimum size of the response body to trigger saving the response to a file.

## Compile the Go Program
A prep script exists to assist with setting up the environment, downloading dependencies and compiling the program for linux and windows.  I usually do not test these tools on windows.

```bash
./prep.sh
```

## Usage

1. **Create a Configuration File**: Modify the `config.json` file to suit your needs or use the default configuration generated by the tool.

2. **Run the Tool**: Execute the tool with the following command:

```bash
dirTraversal.bin -config config.json
```

3. **Review Output**: The tool will send requests to the target URL with the specified payloads. Responses that exceed the configured body size will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Example

To test for Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities, you can configure the tool to use a list of LFI payloads and target a vulnerable endpoint. The tool will send each payload and save any responses that indicate a potential vulnerability.

## Future Enhancements

- **POST Request Support**: Currently, the tool only supports GET requests. Future versions may include support for POST requests.
- **More Payload Types**: Additional payload types and customization options may be added.

## Dependencies

- **Go Common Functions**: The tool uses a helper package `github.com/thepcn3rd/goAdvsCommonFunctions` for common tasks like directory creation and error handling.
